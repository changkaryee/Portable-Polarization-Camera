# Portable-Polarization-Camera
Introduction:
During the summer of 2022, I began working on a portable polarization camera. Thanks to Dr. Yao’s optical research lab, I gained the knowledge needed to execute this project. My mentor, Jia Wei Zhuo, was an integral part of this process because he taught and introduced me to photonics.

Hypothesis:
By utilizing Stokes parameters, I should be able to create a camera that can see the polarization of different surfaces.

Setup:
3D print all of the pieces in the folder-
Connect piece 1 to piece 2 with superglue-
Attach Raspberry Pie through the hole in piece 1-
Attach the Camera to piece 2 and connect the Camera to the raspberry pie via an Adafruit Flex Cable-
Grab a sheet of polarization film, place the short edge towards your body(this is 0°)-
rotate 45° and cut a sheet out
repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have 4 small pieces of film. Make sure they are organized-
tape the film to the film wheel-
attach a bearing into the film wheel(0.5 in tall, 2 in wide) and the pieces 1+2-

Procedure:
Position the camera and press the button, then wait for 2 minutes.
