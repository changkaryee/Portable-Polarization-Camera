# Portable-Polarization-Camera
Introduction:
During the summer of 2022, I began to work on a portable polarization camera. Thanks to Dr. Yao’s optical research lab, I was able to gain the knowledge needed to execute this project. My mentor, Jia Wei Zhuo, was an integral part of this process because he was the one who taught and introduced me to photonics.

Problem:
After my Internship at Dr. Yao’s optical research lab, I recieved a small glimpse into photonics. However, when I realized that optical engineering is overlooked by highschool students, I wanted to give it the attention and awareness it deserves. 
Objective:
By developing a portable polarization camera, I will be able to demonstrate the potential of optical engineering.

Setup:
3D print all of the pieces in the folder-
Connect piece 1 to piece 2 with superglue-
Attach Raspberry Pie through the hole in piece 1-
Attach the Camera to piece 2 and connect the Camera to the raspberry pie via an Adafruit Flex Cable-
Grab a sheet of polarization film, place the short edge towards your body(this is 0°)-
rotate 45° and cut a sheet out-
repeat step 5 and 6 until you have 4 small pieces of film. Make sure they are organized-
tape the film to the film wheel-
attach a bearing into the film wheel(0.5 in tall, 2 in wide) and the pieces 1+2-

Procedure:
Position the camera and press the button, then wait for 2 minutes.
